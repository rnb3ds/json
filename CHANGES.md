## v1.5.1 - Correctness, Determinism, Security & Performance (2026-08-30)

> Sweep of encoding correctness (`PreserveNumbers`, streaming decoder, custom encoder), deterministic output ordering, security-scan and path-symlink hardening, plus profiled performance work. Non-breaking.

### Breaking Changes

- None — no exported symbol removed or signature changed; behavioral tightening only where it aligns with documented contracts
- `Marshal` without cfg now enforces `MaxJSONSize` (was unchecked), and map-derived result/callback order is now deterministic (ascending key order, previously random per run)

### Fixed

- `PreserveNumbers` round-trips: `Marshal`/`EncodeWithConfig` emit raw number literals — library `Number` gained `MarshalJSON` (several paths emitted quoted `"1.10"`)
- Non-string map keys no longer collapse to the same `"<T Value>"` placeholder — formatted per kind and sorted (`encoding/json` semantics)
- `[]byte` values encode as base64 strings (was a numeric byte array like `[104,105]`)
- `CustomEscapes`/`DisableEscaping` now apply to struct values too (previously only map values)
- Pretty-printed maps whose values are all filtered out no longer emit dangling indent lines
- FastEncoder rejects `NaN`/`±Inf`, encodes `nil` containers as `null`, validates `json.Number` literals, and bounds container nesting depth
- Streaming `Decoder` accepts mixed nesting (`{"a":[1]}`) via a per-level closer stack
- `Decoder.Decode` with `UseNumber` no longer panics on `null` or number-into-map/slice targets — proper `UnmarshalTypeError`
- Unpaired surrogates substitute U+FFFD (stdlib parity); offset accounting, literal error `Offset`s, and `NewDecoder` default `maxBytes` fixed
- `escapeRune` escapes U+2028/U+2029 under `EscapeHTML` and emits stdlib's `�` text for invalid UTF-8
- Token-path `parseString`/`parseNumber` enforce per-byte size limits (a hostile reader could grow the buffer unboundedly)
- Schema validation works under `PreserveNumbers` — type checks, min/max/multipleOf, and cross-kind enum equality all handle `Number`
- `UniqueItems` no longer flags `[1,"1"]` as duplicates (dedup keys are type-qualified)
- Negative-step slices clamp `end` — `a[4:-10:-1]` previously panicked on Get/Set/Delete
- Cache `Delete` removes entries whose keys exceed `MaxCacheKeyLength` (Set/Get truncated keys, Delete didn't)
- `GetCompiled` returns an error on a nil `*CompiledPath` (was a panic)
- `GetTyped` no longer panics comparing func-bearing `Hooks`/`CustomTypeEncoders` configs
- `SetCreate`/`SetMultipleCreate`/`DeleteClean` inherit the processor's config — security limits were silently reset to defaults
- `Delete` fast path no longer skips array cleanup when `CompactArrays` is set
- `getProcessorWithConfig` no longer serves a cached wrong `CustomPathParser` (the config hash could not distinguish parsers)
- `Set`/`SetMultiple`/`Delete`/`GetMultiple` increment operation/error stats — `GetStats` previously showed zero write operations
- `IsClosed` reports true during the closing window (the registry kept handing out processors whose ops failed)
- Parallel `Filter` preserves input order; worker errors are no longer shadowed by `ctx.Err()`; chunk data is released to pools
- `IterableValue.Release()` guards against double-put when released inside a callback
- `ParseJSONL`/`ToJSONL`/`StreamLinesInto` use the default/global processor when no cfg is given (as documented)
- `AccessResult.AsString` wraps `ErrTypeMismatch` so `errors.Is` works as documented
- Health check reads memory stats directly before any recorded operation (previously reported Healthy prematurely)
- Numeric conversions: platform-dependent float→int bounds fixed; `GetFloat` returns the documented default on NaN/Inf tokens; `Number("0.0")` counts as zero
- `IndexIgnoreCase` ASCII folding no longer rewrites non-letter bytes (`'['` matched `'{'`)
- `MarshalToFile` honors all encoding options (`Indent`/`Prefix`/`EscapeHTML` were silently dropped)
- `SaveToFile`/`SaveToWriter` pass cfg into comment/whitespace preprocessing (options were ignored)
- File-size validation honors per-call `cfg.MaxJSONSize` and no longer applies to write targets (overwriting a large existing file failed with `ErrSizeLimit`)
- `JSONLMaxLineSize` values below 64KB are now effective — the 64KB bufio initial buffer swallowed the limit (5 scan sites)
- `NDJSONProcessor.ProcessReader` honors the JSONL config knobs (line size, memory, comments) instead of ignoring them
- Atomic writes follow the leaf symlink (restores `os.WriteFile` semantics)

### Security

- Custom dangerous patterns containing uppercase letters now match — previously never detected at all
- Custom patterns longer than the built-in window overlap no longer escape detection at rolling-window boundaries
- `cachedMaxPatternLen` recompute race fixed — concurrent registry writes could leave a stale, too-small overlap
- `validatePathSymlinks` resolves intermediate directory symlinks before the restricted-dir check (lexical check was bypassable)
- `sanitizePath` redacts before truncating — long paths previously skipped sensitive-pattern checks; slow-op success logs are sanitized too

### Changed

- Map-derived order is deterministic everywhere: `Get` wildcard/distributed results, `Foreach*` callbacks, `Iterator` traversal, `SetMultiple` application, and schema error lists follow ascending key order
- Iterator keys are no longer interned — transient one-shot keys were pinning a 10MB process cache and taking its lock
- Examples: all 17 examples extended — uncovered package-level APIs 40 → 10 (remaining are deprecated or Processor-mirrored)
- Test coverage raised (main 80.5% → 81.4%, internal 84.5% → 87.6%); D-002 regression files consolidated 4 → 1

### Performance

- `Marshal`/`EncodeWithConfig`/`ToJSONL` fast path emits `[]byte` in a single copy (was a string→[]byte double copy per encode)
- Validation hashing halved to one full-input scan per operation (cached `Get`: 3 → 2); exact-input comparison still guards identity
- Clean security windows skip per-pattern scanning via a first-char bucket prefilter — detection stays byte-identical
- Maps with ≤1 key encode with zero allocation (`iter.Seq2` range-over-func; multi-key paths keep the existing sort)
- `SetMultiple` drops a defensive deep-copy of just-parsed data; the per-processor path-segment cache now delegates to the process-level one

## v1.5.0 - API Unification, Correctness, Security & Performance (2026-07-15)

> Major effort: package-level ↔ Processor API mirror completed, per-call config enforced everywhere, encoding/json compatibility hardened, broad correctness and performance work. Non-breaking.

### Breaking Changes

- None — no exported symbol removed or signature changed; all new parameters are optional trailing `cfg ...Config`; `Encode` retained as a deprecated alias
- `MaxObjectKeys`/`MaxArrayElements` are now enforced (previously declared but never checked) — flat structures exceeding the default 5000 keys/elements now return `ErrSizeLimit` (aligns behavior with the documented `SecurityConfig` limits; was a silent no-op bug)

### Added

- Package-level `Marshal`/`Unmarshal`/`MarshalIndent`/`Valid`/`CompareJSON` accept optional `cfg ...Config`, mirroring their `Processor` methods (encoding/json drop-in compatibility preserved)
- `CompactString(jsonStr, cfg)` — string-form mirror of `Processor.Compact`, resolving the `Compact` (buffer form) / `CompactString` (string form) naming split
- `Processor.CompareJSON`/`MergeJSON`/`MergeMany` methods mirror the package-level functions; the `ForeachFile` family accepts a trailing `cfg ...Config`
- `Config.CacheSharedResults` opt-in — cached `Get`/`GetFromParsed` skip the defensive deep-copy for up to ~14× faster repeated large reads (caller must not mutate returned containers)
- Per-call `cfg` security limits (`MaxJSONSize`, `MaxNestingDepthSecurity`, `FullSecurityScan`, …) now take effect across Get/Set/Delete/Valid/Parse/iteration/JSONL/file paths (previously ignored on most methods)
- All user-callback paths (`Foreach*`, `StreamJSONL*`, `MapJSONL`/`ReduceJSONL`/…, `ProcessReader`, `ForeachFileChunked`, `ParallelIterator` workers) recover panics into errors instead of crashing the process
- `Set`/`Delete` on arrays now support index/wildcard/range/multi-field targets — `Set([*].name)`, `Set([0:2].field)`, `Set/Delete([*].{a,b})`
- Bare numeric (`0`, `-1`) and wildcard (`*`) path segments now parse as array-index/wildcard — `Get(arr,"0")` ≡ `Get(arr,"[0]")`, `Get(arr,"*")` ≡ `Get(arr,"[*]")`

### Fixed

- `SetFromParsed` returns the modified document (was the set value), so `GetFromParsed` reads all paths correctly afterward
- Hooks (`AddHook`/`Config.Hooks`) now fire on Get/Set/Delete; the After chain observes Set/Delete string results
- Library `Number` type no longer degrades to `string` under `PreserveNumbers` (deep-copy switches + encoder now handle it)
- Float encoding byte-matches `encoding/json` (large/small exponents, `-0`, `NaN`/`Inf` → error); `Marshal`/`FastEncoder.EncodeMap` output is deterministic (sorted keys) and `nil` slice/map → `null`
- Slice `step` honored on Set/Delete/extract-then-slice; reverse slices `[::-1]` no longer panic
- `Delete` unified onto the recursive processor — `[*]`/`{a,b}`/`[a:b]` deletions now work (were silent no-ops)
- Non-BMP characters (emoji, CJK ext.) emit UTF-16 surrogate pairs under `EscapeUnicode` (was corrupted to wrong code points)
- `CompiledPath` reverse slice `[::-1]` returns the reversed array (was empty)
- `MinProcessingTime` metric replaces its `-1` sentinel on the first value (was stuck at 0, masking latency spikes)
- `convertToUint64` accepts the full `(MaxInt64, MaxUint64]` range via `ParseUint` fallback; `ProcessBatch` honors per-call `cfg.MaxBatchSize`
- `Unmarshal` with no config now runs security validation (was skipped, unlike `Parse`)
- `KeyIntern.Clear()` uses a concurrent-safe in-place clear (the prior field-swap was a data race)
- Cache `Get`/`Set` shard consistency for long keys (`> MaxCacheKeyLength`); `safeCopyResult` returns `nil` on deep-copy failure
- File ops honor per-call `cfg.MaxJSONSize` at read time; `SaveToFile`/`MarshalToFile` write atomically (temp + rename) — no truncation on crash; `report...draft.json` no longer mis-flagged as path traversal
- Stream iterators enforce `cfg.MaxJSONSize`; a top-level object stream now errors instead of returning the first key as a value
- `StreamJSONL` workers pre-check nesting depth and recover panics
- Documented error sentinels (`ErrDepthLimit`/`ErrPathNotFound`/`ErrSizeLimit`/`ErrConcurrencyLimit`) now returned where specified

### Changed

- `Encode` (method + package func) deprecated in favor of `EncodeWithConfig`/`Marshal`; physical removal deferred to the next major version
- `Marshal`/`FastEncoder` output is deterministic and `encoding/json`-compatible by default (sorted map keys, `RFC3339Nano` time, `nil` → `null`)
- Dead-code removal: ~16 complex-path functions in `operation_delete.go`, `recursive.go` self-assignments/dead branches, `escapeJSONPointer`, and ~7 unused path helpers
- Test coverage raised 76% → 82.4%; D-002 regression files consolidated 7 → 3

### Performance

- `snapshotHooks` lock skipped on the common no-hook path via an `atomic.Bool` gate — `Concurrent_Get` ~23% faster
- `InternBytes` cache-hit path is zero-allocation (was 26 B / 5 allocs), ~37% lower latency
- `CacheSharedResults` skips the defensive deep-copy on cache hits — up to ~14× faster repeated large reads
- Cache invalidation fast-path skips the write-lock scan when the cache is empty — `Set`/`Delete` ~40% faster under default config

### Security

- `MaxObjectKeys`/`MaxArrayElements` enforced via a single-pass byte scan — blocks flat-but-wide DoS (e.g. a million-key object) that previously bypassed nesting/bracket checks
- Per-call security limits enforced across all config-accepting methods
- All user-callback paths recover panics — a misbehaving callback can no longer crash the process

---

## v1.4.3 - Performance, Quality, Security & Concurrency Improvements (2026-06-19)

### Breaking Changes

- None — no exported symbol removed or signature changed; fully backward compatible

### Fixed

- `Schema.Pattern` lazy-compile data race serialized via `sync.Once`; a shared `*Schema` validated concurrently no longer races
- `validateIPv6Format` accepts zero-compressed IPv6 (`fe80::1`, `2001:db8::1`); the hand-rolled regex previously rejected every `::` form, now delegates to `net.ParseIP`
- `SetMultiple` invalidates the JSON cache before marshalling (matches `Set`), preventing stale Get/parse results for the same input
- `Delete` returns the original `jsonStr` on failure instead of `""`, honoring the documented "input unchanged" contract
- `SkipValidation` still validates path syntax — `arr[xyz]` is rejected instead of coerced to index 0
- JSON Pointer out-of-bounds array set returns a clear error instead of silently dropping the value
- `Foreach`/`ForeachWithPath`/`ForeachNested` and error-returning variants deep-copy the `Get()` result before iterating; a mutation callback could previously corrupt the cached parse object (a data race under concurrency)
- `MetricsCollector.Reset()`/`GetMetrics()` no longer race on the multi-word `startTime`; torn reads corrupting `Uptime` fixed
- Document get/parse/encode cache hash now covers the full document (was sampled on >4KB docs, colliding and serving one document's cached result for another)
- On config-processor-cache contention, `getProcessorWithConfig` returns a freshly-built processor uncached instead of failing the caller's Get/Set/Parse/JSONL operation (the cache is an optimization and must never break user-facing calls)
- `Close()` no longer drains the shared concurrency semaphore (could steal an in-flight op's release token → shutdown hang); tracks in-flight ops via an atomic counter and preserves resources on timeout instead of tearing down mid-flight ops
- `asyncCloseProcessor` goroutine leak fixed; `maybeEvictConfigCache` releases the cache lock before the async close send (was stalling every config-based call under churn)
- `SetGlobalProcessor`/`ShutdownGlobalProcessor` now swap under the global lock and close the old processor outside it; `Break()` on the parallel `StreamJSONL` path now stops other workers (stop signal was lost)
- `CustomTypeEncoders`/`CustomValidators` config-cache hash made deterministic (was iterating a map in random order and collapsing encoder identity to a bool)
- `logError` "concurrent_ops" field now loads the correct counter

### Security

- Array extension by a huge index (e.g. `"/a/99999999"`, `"a[0:999999999]"`) is now bounded (`maxArrayExtension = 1,000,000`) in both dot-notation and JSON Pointer paths — previously called `make([]any, index+1)`, risking OOM
- Validation cache no longer trusts the non-cryptographic FNV hash as identity: it compares the exact validated input before skipping checks (a hash collision previously skipped all UTF-8/BOM/structure/security checks)
- `RedactedPath` masks every non-empty path to `"***"` (was leaking the first/last 8 bytes of paths longer than 32)

### Performance

- Defensive deep copy of cached `Get()` results no longer re-boxes immutable leaves; cached array/object Get ~97% fewer allocs (~20% faster), cached `Get(".")` on a 1000-element array ~67% fewer allocs
- Cache read-path LRU write-lock contention cut via an adaptive `MoveToFront` interval; `Concurrent_Get` ~2× faster (~530 → ~260 ns/op), eviction quality preserved
- Validation cache key changed to a fixed-size struct, eliminating a ~50 B per-operation string allocation on every validated Get/Set/Delete
- Governed-op lifecycle (`beginGovernedOp`/`endGovernedOp`) halves closure allocations; the concurrency semaphore moved from a buffered channel to an atomic counter; default-config detection uses pointer identity — `Concurrent_Get` 2→1 allocs/op, `Set`/`Delete` ~13% fewer allocs

### Changed

- `EncodeBatch`/`EncodeFields`/`EncodeStream`/`SaveToFile`/`MarshalToFile`/`SaveToWriter` now honor `SetGlobalProcessor` (unified package-level delegation path) — previously bypassed the caller's global processor and its hooks/metrics
- GoDoc: documented exported error conditions across `Marshal`/`Unmarshal`/`Encode*`/`ValidateSchema`/JSONL/iterator/file/helper APIs; filled missing comments
- `DefaultMaxDepth` (100) and `maxArrayExtension` (1,000,000) extracted as named constants referenced by `DefaultConfig`/`ValidateWithWarnings`
- Examples reviewed: error-handling retry logic uses the real configurable errors (`ErrSizeLimit`/`ErrDepthLimit`) instead of reserved/deprecated ones; path-validation demo classifies actual errors; counter renamed and dead switch cases removed

### Removed

- Dead internal code only (no public API impact): the unused `bulkProcessor`/`decoderPool` subsystem (~200 lines), the `resourceMonitor` subsystem, the `encoderConfig` interface + accessors, ~17 test-only Config accessors, dead helpers (`isValidPath`, `safeConvert*` wrappers, `formatNumber`, `internKey`), and unused hash variants

---

## v1.4.2 - Performance, Quality & Security Improvements (2026-05-14)

### Added

- Export `Marshaler`, `Unmarshaler`, `TextMarshaler`, `TextUnmarshaler` interfaces for encoding/json compatibility
- UTF-16 surrogate pair handling in streaming Decoder (RFC 8259 §7)
- Streaming byte limit enforcement in `Decoder` to prevent memory exhaustion from malicious input
- Concurrency semaphore integration for `Get()`, `Set()`, `Delete()` — bounded parallelism per processor
- `CacheManager.DeleteByPrefix()` for complete prefix-based cache eviction
- Panic recovery in hook execution — misbehaving hooks no longer crash the processor
- Streaming types documentation (Encoder, Decoder, Number, Token, Delim, StreamIterator, ParallelIterator)
- `Iterator.Reset()` / `ResetWith()` documented as not concurrency-safe
- Comprehensive boundary condition tests for low-coverage functions

### Fixed

- `JSONLWriter.Write` uses pooled encoding with HTML escape support
- Path segment pool identity preserved — `getPathSegments`/`putPathSegments` use `*[]PathSegment`
- Shared mutable `cachedDefaultConfigPtr` removed — prevents silent cross-request config mutation
- `scanWithRollingWindow` offset progression fix — prevents data skipping at chunk boundaries
- `shouldUseDistributedArrayOp` heuristic improved — stricter sampling prevents false positives on regular nested arrays
- `extendArrayAndSetValue` / `extendArrayAndSetSliceValue` guard against theoretical out-of-bounds panic
- `readContainerValue` validates bracket matching at all nesting depths (was depth==1 only)

### Changed

- Validation cache key generation: SHA-256 (~100ns) → FNV-1a dual-hash (~4ns), ~50x speedup per Get/Set/Parse
- Fast path for simple property access in `Get()`, `Set()`, `Delete()` — bypasses hash, cache, and recursive processor
- `strconv.Atoi` in path parsing hot paths replaced with zero-allocation `ParseIntFast`
- `GlobalPathIntern` changed to zero-capacity lazy init from eager 25000-entry allocation
- `operation.go` (2162 lines) split into focused files: operation_delete.go, operation_set.go, operation_array.go
- `processor.go` (1784 lines) split into 7 focused files: lifecycle, get, set, delete, iterate, stats, cache
- `encoding.go` split into encoding.go (codec), encoding_schema.go (validation), encoding_format.go (formatting)
- `iterator.go` split into iterator.go, iterable_value.go, iterator_stream.go, iterator_parallel.go
- Modernized to Go 1.22+ idioms: range-over-int, reflect.Pointer, slices.Sort, maps.Copy
- IterableValue accessor methods (~400 lines duplication) consolidated to ~120 lines with generic helpers
- `EncodeWithConfig` delegates to shared `encodeWithConfigToBytes`, eliminating ~80 lines duplicated logic
- `prepareOptions` returns fresh pooled copy from cached default — no shared mutable state
- `getHooks` uses copy-on-write pattern — zero allocation for common no-hook case
- Config comparison for cache keys uses value equality instead of pointer identity
- `fallbackProcessor` uses minimal config (no cache, no metrics) to reduce memory footprint

---

## v1.4.1 - Performance, Security & Quality Improvements (2026-05-08)

### Breaking Changes

- `Config.Context` field removed — use `GetWithContext(ctx, jsonStr, path)` for context cancellation

### Added

- `GetWithContext(ctx, jsonStr, path)` — context-aware Get with cancellation support
- `ParsedJSON.Release()` — prevents resource leak when ParsedJSON no longer needed
- `processor_cache.go` — cache management extracted from processor.go for separation of concerns
- Security and coverage tests for depth limits, schema regex caching, JSONL memory enforcement

### Fixed

- `MaxDepth=0` now correctly means "no limit" instead of blocking all nested encoding
- `StreamJSONLChunked` returns IterableValue objects to pool after chunk processing (allocation pressure)
- `ParallelIterator.Close()` signals goroutines to stop via done channel (goroutine leak fix)
- `StreamJSONL` methods now respect `Config.JSONLBufferSize` and `Config.JSONLMaxLineSize` settings
- `GetMultiple()` returns first error from failed paths instead of silently swallowing errors
- `Encoder.Encode()` fast path checks output size against `MaxJSONSize`
- `validateNestingDepth` fast path returns properly wrapped `ErrDepthLimit` for `errors.Is()` matching
- Nil pointer dereference in `logError()` when `EnableMetrics=false`
- `configPool` reference leaks — reference-type fields cleared before pool return
- Decoder pool `useNumber`/`disallowUnknownFields` leakage between pooled decoders

### Changed

- Schema regex lazily compiled and cached on first validation (prevents ReDoS)
- Validation cache uses SHA-256 for all JSON sizes (eliminates FNV-1a collision bypass)
- Deep copy functions enforce depth limit of 200 (prevents stack overflow DoS)
- `StreamJSONL`/`StreamJSONLChunked` enforce `Config.JSONLMaxMemory` limit
- `IsValidJSONNumber()` enforces leading-zero rule consistently across all paths
- `fastSet`/`fastDelete`/`batchSetOptimized`/`batchDeleteOptimized`/`fastGetMultiple` marked EXPERIMENTAL
- Removed duplicate `isValidJSONNumber()` from fast_encoder.go (70 lines deduplicated)
- `fastParseInt()` and `ParseArrayIndex()` delegate to `ParseIntFast()` (eliminates ~50 lines duplication)

### Performance

- `navigateDotNotation` hot path: direct Type enum replaces `TypeString()` string comparison
- `Set()`/`Delete()`/`SetMultiple()`: `FastMarshalToString` replaces `json.Marshal` output serialization
- `preservingUnmarshal`: `bytes.NewReader` replaces `strings.NewReader(string(data))` allocation
- Array index parsing: `ParseArrayIndex` replaces `strconv.Atoi` in deletion hot paths
- Path building in iteration: byte append pattern replaces string concatenation per iteration

### Removed

- `internal.MergeObjects()` — duplicates `DeepMerge` functionality
- `internal.DetectConsecutiveExtractions()` / `ExtractionGroup` — dead code
- `Processor.compactBuffer()` — dead method

---

## v1.4.0 - API Unification & Security Hardening (2026-04-13)

### Fixed

**Security:**
- Added depth limit to `Decoder.readContainerValue()` — prevents stack overflow from deeply nested JSON
- Added per-line nesting depth validation and size limit to `NDJSONProcessor.ProcessReader()`
- Replaced `os.ReadFile` with `io.LimitReader` in `readValidatedFile/UnmarshalFromFile` — prevents TOCTOU race
- `FastEncoder` now escapes `<`, `>`, `&` when `htmlEscape` enabled (CWE-79 XSS)
- Essential validation (size + depth) always enforced even with `SkipValidation: true` (CWE-20)
- Sensitive data sampling expanded: head 100 / tail 50 / middle 20 uniform samples
- File paths sanitized in error messages to prevent information disclosure

**Data races & concurrency:**
- Fixed `ParallelMap` data race — concurrent map writes replaced with local-slice-per-goroutine pattern
- Fixed `CacheManager` WaitGroup reuse panic — added atomic `closed` flag
- Fixed `StringIntern` stats/trim races — atomic loads + CAS guard
- Fixed `SetErrorSentinels` data race — added `sync.Once`
- Fixed `ForEachWithContext` goroutine leak — select on `ctx.Done()` during semaphore acquire
- Fixed `CompiledPathCache.Get` TOCTOU race — clone within same lock scope

**Resource & memory leaks:**
- Fixed `configPool` reference leaks — all reference-type fields cleared before pool return
- Fixed `Processor.Close()` no longer clears global caches (moved to `ShutdownGlobalProcessor()`)
- Fixed `Get()` cache hit corrupts cache — deep-copy mutable values on cache hit
- Fixed `ShutdownGlobalProcessor()` now clears all cached processors and global caches
- Added timeout protection to stale processor close goroutine

**Error handling & correctness:**
- Restored error chains in `Delete/Set/EncodeWithConfig/SaveToWriter/Parse/Prettify/Compact`
- `NDJSONProcessor.ProcessReader` no longer silently discards parse errors
- `readValidatedReader` size check now uses local `maxSize` (was reading `p.config.MaxJSONSize` which could be 0)
- `shallowCopyMap/shallowCopySlice` now propagate depth counter (was resetting to 0, bypassing stack overflow protection)
- `Encoder.Encode` no longer unconditionally overrides processor's `EscapeHTML` config
- `readContainerValue` validates closing delimiter matches opening
- `readContainerValue` returns error on truncated EOF
- `ValidateString` uses `utf8.RuneCountInString` for Unicode-correct length
- `multipleOf` validation uses epsilon tolerance for IEEE 754 safety
- `CompareJSON` now normalizes `Number` to `float64` for correct equality

**Nil receiver safety:**
- All public types (`Processor`, `Config`, `JsonsError`, `JSONLWriter`, `NDJSONProcessor`, error types) return safe defaults on nil receiver

### Changed

- All APIs unified to variadic `cfg ...Config` pattern (Encoder, Decoder, StreamIterator, JSONL, iterators)
- Dual-layer API consistency: every package-level function delegates to corresponding Processor method
- `Encoder` inherits processor config as base; explicit fields still take priority
- `NDJSONProcessor` now respects `JSONLContinueOnErr` config
- `StreamJSONL` methods use `shouldSkipJSONLLineFromConfig` respecting `JSONLSkipEmpty`/`JSONLSkipComments`
- `Valid()` delegates to `Processor.ValidBytes()` eliminating input type mismatch
- `Compact()` delegates to `Processor.CompactBuffer()` aligning dual-layer signatures
- `ForeachFileChunked` uses `iterableValuePool` and releases values after chunk callback
- Unified negative index handling into `normalizeNegativeIndex` helpers (8+ patterns consolidated)
- `navigateToParent` helper deduplicates delete navigation logic (~40 lines eliminated)
- `withTypedGetter[T]`/`withConfigProcessor[T]` generics eliminate typed getter boilerplate
